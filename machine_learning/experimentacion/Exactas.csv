Background Wind
Background Flow",The effect of stochastic fluctuations in the background zonal velocity field on the energy dispersion of stationary wave responses to meridionally localised forcing is considered using the non-divergent barotropic vorticity equation. It is found that for small noise levels or large lengthscales in the noise autocovariance function the oscillatory structure of the solutions is not altered. However for noise levels (or autocovariance lengthscales) comparable to or larger (smaller) than those observed in the circulation at 300mb the marginal density functions of the solution process displays a pronounced attenuation away from the stationary wave source. This indicates that fluctuations in the velocity field inhibit the dispersion of wave energy. The symmetry of the marginal PDFs about the source rather than about the equator indicates that the localisation is primarily an integrated effect of backscattering by potential vorticity gradients in regions of real refractive index and not due to attenuation by regions of imaginary refractive index or by critical lines in the flow.,1,Ciencias exactas

two-dimensional wind","To investigate how the propagation of energy away from steady sources may be influenced by the horizontal structure of the time-averaged flow in the troposphere solutions to a barotropic model are displayed and interpreted. The model is steady and linearized about a basic state which varies in latitude and longitude. Emphasis is placed on cases where the longitudinal variations are gradual.

Many of the results can be analyzed by locally applying tools developed for zonally symmetric basic states e.g. ray tracing and refractive indices. Simple background flows are constructed which have longitudinally confined critical lines reflective surfaces wave guides and regions conducive to propagation. An example is given in which longitudinal derivatives of the basic state are significant. The theory of ray tracing in a two-dimensional wind must be employed as an interpretive tool in this case. It is concluded that zonal variations tend to enhance poleward (equatorward) propagation in large-scale troughs (ridges).

Examples are also shown of propagation through observed January 300 mb mean flow. These experiments suggest that the southern flank of the Asiatic jet may act as a partial reflector increasing the likelihood of resonance in the midlatitudes. The central tropical Pacific appears to have potential as a corridor for inter-hemispheric transmission though during typical January conditions wavetrains emanating from the mid-latitudes are absorbed there.",0,Ciencias exactas
Do Rossby-wave critical layers absorb reflect or over-reflect?,"hydrodynamically
two-dimensional 
asymptotic expansions","The Stewartson–Warn–Warn (SWW) solution for the time evolution of an inviscid nonlinear Rossby-wave critical layer which predicts that the critical layer will alternate between absorbing and over-reflecting states as time goes on is shown to be hydrodynamically unstable. The instability is a two-dimensional shear instability owing its existence to a local reversal of the cross-stream absolute vorticity gradient within the long thin Kelvin cat's eyes of the SWW streamline pattern. The unstable condition first develops while the critical layer is still an absorber well before the first over-reflecting stage is reached. The exponentially growing modes have a two-scale cross-stream structure like that of the basic SWW solution. They are found analytically using the method of matched asymptotic expansions enabling the problem to be reduced to a transcendental equation for the complex eigenvalue. Growth rates are of the order of the inner vorticity scale δq i.e. the initial absolute vorticity gradient dq0/dy times the critical-layer width scale. This is much faster than the time evolution of the SWW solution itself albeit much slower than the shear rate du0/dy of the basic flow. Nonlinear saturation of the growing instability is expected to take place in a central region of width comparable to the width of the SWW cat's-eye pattern probably leading to chaotic motion there with very large ‘eddy-viscosity’ values. Those values correspond to critical-layer Reynolds numbers δ−1 [Lt ] 1 suggesting that for most initial conditions the time evolution of the critical layer will depart drastically from that predicted by the SWW solution. A companion paper (Haynes 1985) establishes that the instability can indeed grow to large enough amplitudes for this to happen.

The simplest way in which the instability could affect the time evolution of the critical layer would be to prevent or reduce the oscillations between over-reflecting and absorbing states which according to the SWW solution follow the first onset of perfect reflection. The possibility that absorption (or over-reflection) might be prolonged indefinitely is ruled out in many cases of interest (even if the ‘eddy viscosity’ is large) by the existence of a rigorous general upper bound on the magnitude of the time-integrated absorptivity α(t). The bound is uniformly valid for all time t. The absorptivity α(t) is defined as the integral over all past t of the jump in the wave-induced Reynolds stress across the critical layer. In typical cases the bound implies that no matter how large t may become |α(t)| cannot greatly exceed the rate of absorption predicted by linear theory multiplied by the timescale on which linear theory breaks down say the time for the cat's-eye flow to twist up the absolute vorticity contours by about half a turn. An alternative statement is that |α(t)| cannot greatly exceed the initial absolute vorticity gradient dq0/dy times the cube of the widthscale of the critical layer. In typical cases therefore a brief answer to the question posed in the title is that the critical layer absorbs at first at a rate ∞ dq0/dy whereas after linear theory breaks down the critical layer becomes a perfect reflector in the long-time average. If absolute vorticity gradients vanish throughout the critical layer then the bound is zero implying perfect reflection for all t.

The general conditions for the bound to apply are that the wave amplitude and critical-layer width are uniformly bounded for all t the motion is two-dimensional and vorticity is neither created nor destroyed within the critical layer nor transported into or out of it by diffusion by advection or by other means. Vorticity may however be diffused or turbulently transported within the critical layer provided that the region within which the transport acts is of bounded width and the range of values of vorticity within that region remains bounded. There are no other restrictions on wave amplitude none on wavelength and no assumptions about flow details within the critical layer nor about the initial vorticity profile qo(y) apart from an assumption that q0(y) has singularities no worse than a finite number of jump discontinuities. The proof in its most general form makes use of anew finite-amplitude conservation theorem for disturbances to parallel shear flows generalizing the classical results of Taylor Eliassen & Palm and others.",0,Ciencias exactas
The Global Atmospheric Response to Low-Frequency Tropical Forcing: Zonally Averaged Basic States,"low-frequency

extratropics
energy dispersion
amplitude","The extratropical response to localized low-frequency tropical forcing is examined using a linearized non-divergent barotropic model on a sphere. Zonal-mean basic states characterized by solid-body rotation or critical latitudes are considered. An analytical analysis based on WKB and ray tracing methods shows that in contrast to stationary Rossby waves westward moving low-frequency Rossby waves can propagate through the tropical easterlies into the extratropics. It is shown analytically that the difference between the stationary and low-frequency ray paths is proportional to the forcing frequency and inversely proportional to the zonal wavenumber cubed. An expression for the disturbance amplitude is derived that shows the ability of the forced waves to maintain their strength well into middle latitudes depends on their meridional wave scale and northward group velocity both of which are functions of the slowly varying background flow.

A local energetics analysis shows that the combination of energy dispersion from the forcing region and energy extraction from the equatorward flank of the midlatitude jet produces disturbances that have the greatest impact on the extratropical circulation. Under the assumption that the forcing amplitude is independent of frequency this impact is largest when the tropical forcing period is in the range 10–20 days.",0,Ciencias exactas

sensitive
oscillation","A spherical nondivergent barotropic model linearized about a 300-mb climatological January flow is used to examine the extratropical response to low-frequency tropical forcing. A two-dimensional WKB analysis shows that the energy propagation depends on the sum of three vectors: the basic state wind vector a vector that is parallel to the absolute vorticity contours and the local wave vector. The latter two vectors are functions of the slowly varying background flow and forcing frequency ω. As ω decreases the ray paths approach that of the local wave vector so that the energy propagates in a direction perpendicular to the wave fronts. The extratropical jet streams have a stronger influence on the long period (>30 day) ray paths than on those of intermediate period (∼10–30 day).

Global and local energetics calculations show that the energy conversion from the zonally varying basic flow increases as ω decreases. The local energetics show that for the long period disturbances both the energy conversion and energy redistribution due to advection and pressure work are significant along the North African–Asian jet stream. The long period disturbances are less sensitive to the location of the tropical forcing than those of intermediate period. This provides a plausible explanation for the observations showing that the long period oscillations tend to be geographically fixed at the exits of the extratropical jet streams whereas those of intermediate period are zonally mobile wave trains. The long (intermediate) timescale disturbances dominate in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere where the zonal variations in the basic flow are more (less) pronounced.",0,Ciencias exactas
Horizontal Structure and Seasonality of Large-Scale Circulations Associated with Submonthly Tropical Convection,"atmospheric

propagate","The relationship between deep tropical convection and large-scale atmospheric circulation in the 6–30-day period range is examined. Regression relationships between filtered outgoing longwave radiation at various locations in the Tropics and 200- and 850-mb circulation are mapped for the standard seasons and the spatial structure and seasonal dependence of the results are interpreted in view of the basic-state circulation.

In regions where the convection is embedded in upper-level easterlies anomalous equatorial easterly flow is typically present at 200 mb within and to the west of the convective signal along with patterns of meridional outflow into subtropical anticyclonic perturbations. Lagged relationships suggest that the convection is forcing the circulation in many of these cases. The outflow and subtropical circulations are strongest into the winter hemisphere during the solstitial seasons with more symmetric signals about the equator seen in the equinoctial seasons. The longitudinal positioning of the subtropical features with respect to the convection varies but is generally located due poleward or just to the east of the convection. There tends to be a first baroclinic mode vertical structure to these circulations such that equatorial westerlies are present at 850 mb within the convection with closed circulations on either side of the equator resembling equatorial Rossby modes especially common over the Atlantic and Pacific sectors.

As a contrast in regions located within upper-level westerlies or along the margin of influence of upper westerly disturbances convection appears to be forced by upper-level wave energy propagating into the deep Tropics with the heating located in the upward motion region ahead of upper-level troughs. This occurs over the Atlantic and eastern Pacific sectors during northern winter and spring and over Australia the South Pacific and South America during southern summer when upper westerlies are at relatively low latitudes where they can interact with deep tropical convection. The results confirm theoretical and modeling ideas that suggest that Rossby wave energy is able to propagate into the deep Tropics in regions where upper-level westerlies exist in the Tropics.",0,Ciencias exactas
Circulation Anomalies Associated with Tropical Convection during Northern Winter,"correlation
hemisphere
amplitude
analyses","Lagged cross correlations between outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and National Meteorological Center global analyses are utilized to isolate the preferred upper-level and surface circulation anomalies associated with tropical convection during northern winter. Three intraseasonal time scales are studied: 30–70 14–30 and 6–14 days. In the 30–70-day band the upper-level circulation signals are zonally elongated with zonal wavenumbers 0–2 dominant. Higher-frequency signals are dominated by zonal wavenumbers 5 and 6. In the 14–30-day band convection over the eastern hemisphere is associated with upper-level anticyclones in the subtropics and appears to be linked in some cases to midlatitude wave trains. The strongest signals are for convection over Africa Australia and the eastern Indian Ocean. Only weak signals are seen for convection over Indonesia. In these regions of upper-level easterlies OLR anomalies peak prior to the maximum anomalies in wind suggesting forcing of the circulation by tropical heating.

In contrast 14–30-day and 6–14-day convection over the eastern tropical Pacific eastern South America and central South Pacific is primarily associated with the intrusion of troughs in the westerlies originating in the extratropics. These are regions of mean upper level westerly flow or where upper-westerlies lie adjacent to tropical convergence zones overlain by only weak easterly flow aloft. The large amplitude of these troughs prior to the OLR anomaly is indicative of the forcing of the convection by these disturbances.",0,Ciencias exactas
Extratropical Forcing of Tropical Pacific Convection during Northern Winter,"intertropical convergence
cold advection
poleward
midlatitude baroclinic","Statistical evidence is presented to support the notion that tropical convection in the eastern Pacific and Atlantic intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) during northern winter can be forced by disturbances originating in the extratropics. The synoptic-scale transients in these regions are characterized at upper levels by strong positive tilts in the horizontal and appear to induce vertical motions ahead of troughs as in midlatitude baroclinic systems. Two case studies of such interactions are examined one for the eastern North Pacific ITCZ and another somewhat different type of interaction for the South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ) over the western South Pacific.

Both cases are associated with upper-level troughs strong cold advection deep into the tropics and the formation of a frontal boundary at low levels. The ITCZ case is characterized by the advection of anomalously high isentropic potential vorticity air southward a strong poleward flux of heat and westerly momentum and the development of a subtropical jet downstream of the disturbance. The SPCZ disturbance is not strongly tilted but is still accompanied by a strong poleward flux of heat and momentum. Evidence for the occurrence of cross-equatorial wave dispersion in the eastern Pacific during northern winter is also presented. These observations are consistent with theory and modeling of Rossby waves in a westerly basic state extending from the midlatitudes into the tropics.",0,Ciencias exactas
Low-Latitude Reflection of Rossby Wave Trains,"nonlinear reflection
absorption-reflection
Numerical experiments
Finite-amplitudes",The nonlinear reflection of an isolated Rossby wave train at a low-latitude wave-breaking region is contrasted with the more familiar longitudinally periodic case. General theoretical arguments for nonlinear reflection based on absorptivity bounds do not carry over to the case of an isolated wave train and detailed investigation is needed to determine the absorption-reflection behavior. Numerical experiments in a single-layer shallow-water model show that wave activity is reflected back into midlatitudes (rather than propagating longitudinally at low latitudes). Finite-amplitudes wave activity diagnostics are used to analyze the nonlinear reflection. Further idealized numerical simulations and simple ideas concerning the propagation of Rossby waves in shear flows are used to give insight into the nonlinear reflection.,0,Ciencias exactas
Forced Rossby wave packets in barotropic shear flows with critical layers,"meridional propagation
monochromatic version
asymptotic
propagating
packet forced",In this paper we investigate the meridional propagation of a forced Rossby wave packet towards a critical layer in a zonal shear flow by solving the linearized barotropic vorticity equation. The forcing is applied north of the critical layer. Two approaches are employed for solving this problem. First an analytic solution valid for large time is derived using Fourier and Laplace transform techniques and asymptotic approximations. This solution exhibits the modification due to the wave packet of the solution obtained by Warn and Warn (1976) [Warn T. Warn H. 1976. On the development of a Rossby wave critical level. J. Atmos. Sci. 33 2021–2024.] in the monochromatic case. A numerical investigation is then carried out using a finite difference scheme and a time-dependent radiation condition. It is found that the forced wave packet is absorbed at the critical layer and the total momentum transferred to the mean flow as a result of the absorption is observed to be proportional to the length scale of the wave packet. We also consider the case of a north–south mean flow with a longitudinally propagating wave packet forced to the east or west of the critical layer. The monochromatic version of this problem has been used before (Geisler J.E. Dickinson R.E. 1975. Critical level absorption of barotropic Rossby waves in a north–south flow. J. Geophys. Res. 80 3805–3811.) to examine the interaction of western boundary currents and oceanic Rossby waves.,0,Ciencias exactas
Rossby Wave Propagation on a Realistic Longitudinally Varying Flow,"barotropic model
meridional vorticity
perturbation vorticity
propagation
low-wavenumber",The response of a barotropic model linearized about a climatological 300-mb December–February time-mean flow to localized forcing is considered. In order to aid the design of the experiments and interpretation of the results a simplified analysis is made of the basic flow in terms of zonal wind meridional vorticity gradient and stationary wavenumber. From the analysis the possible existence of a strong waveguide in the Asian jet and weaker waveguides in the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere jets is deduced. The possibility of propagation into the equatorial east Pacific and Atlantic oceans and even across these regions is also suggested. These features are confirmed by barotropic model integrations for a variety of perturbation vorticity source positions and shapes. These integrations also show preferred propagation regions arching across North America from Europe to the Arabian Gulf and in the Southern Hemisphere into the equatorial Indian Ocean and Indonesian regions. They also show a tendency to produce a low-wavenumber fast westward-moving “tail” along the Asian jet. Many of the features found in this study are remarkably consistent with observational teleconnection studies.,0,Ciencias exactas
The Steady Linear Response of a Spherical Atmosphere to Thermal and Orographic Forcing,"spherical atmosphere
midlatitude thermal
barotropic model
Shorter wavelengths
realistic jet flow","Motivated by some results from barotropic models a linearized steady-state five-layer baroclinic model is used to study the response of a spherical atmosphere to thermal and orographic forcing. At low levels the significant perturbations are confined to the neighborhood of the source and for midlatitude thermal forcing these perturbations are crucially dependent on the vertical distribution of the source. In the upper troposphere the sources generate wavetrains which are very similar to those given by barotropic models. For a low-latitude source long wavelengths propagate strongly polewards as well as eastwards. Shorter wavelengths are trapped equatorward of the poleward flank of the jet resulting in a split of the wave-trains at this latitude. Using reasonable dissipation magnitudes the easiest way to produce an appreciable response in middle and high latitudes is by subtropical forcing. These results suggest an explanation for the shapes of patterns described in observational studies.

The theory for waves propagating in a slowly varying medium is applied to Rossby waves propagating in a barotropic atmosphere. The slow variation of the medium is associated with the sphericity of the domain and the latitudinal structure of the zonal wind. Rays along which wave activity propagates the speeds of propagation and the amplitudes and phases along these rays are determined for a constant angular velocity basic flow as well as a more realistic jet flow. They agree well with the observational and numerical model results and give a simple interpretation of them.",0,Ciencias exactas
Some mathematical remarks concerning the localisation of planetary waves in a stochastic background flow,"Lyapunov Exponent
Negative Eigenvalue
Essential Spectrum
Planetary Wave
Critical Line",In this article we develop some mathematically rigorous ideas to explain the phenomenon of localisation of planetary waves in a stochastic background flow as presented in the physical companion paper. For this purpose the barotropic vorticity equation linearised around a zonal background wind and driven by a local source is transformed into a Sturm-Liouville problem with random potential function. We distinguish between two types of localising mechanisms. The first type is a background effect of localisation symmetrical with respect to the equator which is due to the nodes of the potential function (critical lines). The second is a more subtle effect and forces localisation around the source. It comes from the superposition of the source term with the Green’s kernel expressed in terms of the eigenfunctions of the spectral resolution of the random Sturm-Liouville operators involved. On average this effect is moderate for zero damping and stronger for small non-zero damping.,0,Ciencias exactas

cross-equatorial wave","The ideas of ray tracing from geometrical optics and wave propagation in a slowly varying medium are applied to Rossby waves propagating in a barotropic atmosphere.

The propagation of low-frequency Rossby waves in a zonally symmetric basic state is compared with that for stationary waves presented by Hoskins and Karoly (1981). These ideas are then used to study the propagation of Rossby waves in a basic state with zonally varying middle latitude or low latitude jets. Conditions which allow cross-equatorial wave propagation are presented. For a zonally varying middle latitude jet there is weak wave convergence in regions of decreasing jet speed However this is not sufficient to explain the enhanced wave amplitude found in numerical-model experiments using a zonally varying basic state.",0,Ciencias exactas
Rossby waves in the presence of random currents,"periodic
dispersion equation
physical explanation
grow drawing
wave",The effect of weak random currents on time periodic Rossby waves is determined by a perturbation method devised previously. As a result the dispersion equation for the average Rossby wave is obtained and from it the propagation velocity and decay rate are found. These quantities are evaluated explicitly for steady unidirectional random currents. From the results simple forms are obtained when the Rossby wavelength is either large or small in comparison to the correlation length of the current. For some directions of propagation of the wave the velocity is increased by the current whereas for other directions it is decreased and a physical explanation of this is presented. Random currents will scatter the waves and cause them to decay. If the current motion can add to the energy flux of the waves the energy flux may grow drawing energy from the currents. It is found that east-west currents serve mainly to scatter the waves but north-south currents can contribute to the growth of waves. The growth phenomenon is interpreted as an instability of the currents to Rossby waves to which they can give up some of their energy. The maximum growth rate occurs for waves traveling either northwestward or southwestward because the energy flux of these waves is in the same direction as the direction of the random currents.,0,Ciencias exactas
Large-scale circulation associated with westerly wind bursts and deep convection over the western equatorial Pacific,"deep equatorial

develop
propagation
troposphere",The relationship between deep equatorial convection over the western Pacific and atmospheric circulation during November to February 1986–1992 is studied using cross correlations between outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and National Meteorological Center global analyses. We focus on intraseasonal convective events on the 6- to 30-day timescale over two regions: just east of Borneo and over the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) domain to the northeast of New Guinea. Although comparatively little work has been done on this timescale we show that the bulk of the intraseasonal variability in both convection and low-level circulation over the tropical western Pacific occurs in this period range. As a comparison with these higher-frequency events the evolution of COARE convection on the 30- to 70-day timescale is also considered. The results of the historical data analysis are compared to a case study of deep convection associated with strong surface westerly winds during November 1989. This analysis is meant to serve as a benchmark for future case studies from the Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere COARE experiment and other periods. In general 6- to 30-day equatorial convection in the regions studied occurs in conjunction with low-level equatorial westerly wind anomalies paired anomalous cyclonic circulations straddling the equator and a strengthening of the sea level pressure gradient along the equator. The increase in the pressure gradient appears most often tied to the simultaneous equatorward movement of high-pressure systems originating over southeastern Asia and Australia. A surge of trades over the central Pacific also accompanies the development of convection over both study regions. Following the convective peak the low-level westerlies slowly decay as the northern cyclone moves northwestward away from the equator in a track characteristic of a tropical depression. It is also observed that low-level westerly anomalies occur frequently without deep convection. The vertical structure during convective events along the equator on the 30- to 70-day timescale and over Indonesia in the 6- to 30-day band is baroclinic with easterly anomalies at upper levels overlying low-level westerlies. At 200 mbar a strengthened meridional outflow from the OLR signal into a wave train on the equatorward side of the Asian jet is observed to develop following the convective peak suggesting forcing of this circulation by the convection. Over the COARE domain there is evidence that 6- to 30-day convection often occurs in conjunction with deep westerly flow. It is suggested that these types of events are frequently characterized by vertical propagation of westerlies from the surface to the upper troposphere as is shown for a case study from November 1989. This westerly burst episode is shown to have many features in common with the “typical” case as defined from historical data.,0,Ciencias exactas

21st Century Skills and Competences for New Millennium Learners in OECD Countries,"conceptual frameworks

teaching",This paper discusses issues related to the teaching and assessment of 21st century skills and competencies in OECD countries drawing on the findings of a questionnaire study and other relevant background material such as white papers or curriculum documents. Although all OECD countries were invited to participate in the questionnaire survey responses were received from seventeen countries or regions and the paper focuses primarily on this group. The paper presents a short discussion of the importance and relevance of 21st century skills and competencies in the current policy debate and the definitions and conceptual frameworks that have been used in the literature and proposes a new three-dimensional framework consisting of the dimensions of information communication and ethics and social impact. The findings of the questionnaire survey show that most countries or regions cover 21st century skills and competencies in their regulations guidelines or recommendations for compulsory education. However there are few specific definitions of these skills and competencies at national or regional level and virtually no clear formative or summative assessment policies for these skills. The only evaluation regarding their teaching is often left to external inspectors as part of their whole school audits. Similarly there are few teacher training programmes that target the teaching or development of 21st century skills although there exist several teacher training initiatives that focus on developing teachers’ ICT pedagogical skills most of them optional. The paper discusses the implications of these findings especially with regard to the particular role of ICT in the development of these skills and competencies and issues related to assessment practices and teacher training.,0,Ciencias exactas

The TSRI is a self-report measure assessing teacher perceptions of the quality of their relationship with students from Grade 4 through junior high school. In Study 1 findings from exploratory factor analysis provided evidence for a 3-factor solution (Satisfaction Instrumental Help Conflict) for the scores from the TSRI. Preliminary evidence of convergent and discriminant validity of TSRI scores was also reported. In Study 2 results from confirmatory factor analysis provided additional support for results obtained from Study 1. High internal consistency estimates for TSRI scores from both studies were obtained. Initial evidence of predictive validity for TSRI scores was also presented. TSRI scores show promise as a reliable and potentially valid measure of the quality of teacher-student relationships.,0,Ciencias exactas
The relationships among working memory math anxiety and performance.,"math anxiety
mental addition
transitory disruption",Individuals with high math anxiety demonstrated smaller working memory spans especially when assessed with a computation-based span task. This reduced working memory capacity led to a pronounced increase in reaction time and errors when mental addition was performed concurrently with a memory load task. The effects of the reduction also generalized to a working memory-intensive transformation task. Overall the results demonstrated that an individual difference variable math anxiety affects on-line performance in math-related tasks and that this effect is a transitory disruption of working memory. The authors consider a possible mechanism underlying this effect—disruption of central executive processes—and suggest that individual difference variables like math anxiety deserve greater empirical attention especially on assessments of working memory capacity and functioning.,0,Ciencias exactas
The teacher-student relationship as a developmental context for children with internalizing or externalizing behavior problems.,"behavior problems

Given the time children spend in school there is a need to better understand the normative contexts and processes within schools that may enhance the positive adaptation of children with significant behavior problems. This study evaluated one such context the teacher-student relationship specifically the degree of closeness and conflict in the relationship between urban American elementary schoolchildren with significant externalizing or internalizing behavior problems and their teachers. The results suggest that the qualities of the teacher-student relationship predict children's successful school adjustment. Having a relationship with a teacher characterized by warmth trust and low degrees of conflict was associated with positive school outcomes. Some moderation effects were noted including differential effects for warmth on the reading achievement of children with externalizing distress and conflict on the school adaptation of children with internalizing problems. Results are discussed in light of theory and school-based intervention and prevention efforts.,0,Ciencias exactas
Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change.,"self-efficacy
behavior
psychological changes
behavior
cognitive mechanism",Presents an integrative theoretical framework to explain and to predict psychological changes achieved by different modes of treatment. This theory states that psychological procedures whatever their form alter the level and strength of self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated how much effort will be expended and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces through experiences of mastery further enhancement of self-efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the proposed model expectations of personal efficacy are derived from 4 principal sources of information: performance accomplishments vicarious experience verbal persuasion and physiological states. Factors influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arise from enactive vicarious exhortative and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported from microanalyses of enactive vicarious and emotive modes of treatment that support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral changes.,0,Ciencias exactas
Social Cognitive Theory in Cultural Context,"agentic perspective

cross-culturally",Social cognitive theory adopts an agentic perspective to human development adaptation and change. The theory distinguishes among three modes of agency: personal agency exercised individually proxy agency in which people secure desired outcomes by inﬂuencing others to act on their behalf and collective agency in which people act in concert to shape their future. Contentious dualisms pervade our ﬁeld pitting autonomy against interdependence individualism against collectivism and communality and personal agency against social structure. The determinants and agentic blends of individual proxy and collective instrumentality vary cross-culturally. But all agentic modes are needed to make it through the day whatever the cultural context in which one resides. Cultures are diverse and dynamic social systems not static monoliths. Intracultural diversity and intraindividual variation in psychosocial orientations across spheres of functioning underscore the multifaceted dynamic nature of cultures. The growing globalisation and cultural pluralisation of societies and enmeshment in a cyberworld that transcends time distance place and national borders call for broadening the scope of cross-cultural analyses. The issues of interest center on how national and global forces interact to shape the nature of cultural life.,0,Ciencias exactas
Teacher–Student Relationship Climate and School Outcomes: Implications for Educational Policy Initiatives,"Academic achievement
School dropout
School policy
Teacher evaluation
Teacher reward",In recent discussions regarding concerns about the academic achievement of US students educational policy makers have suggested the implementation of certain teacher policies. To address the limited empirical research on the putative educational impact of such policies this study used multilevel structural equation models to investigate the longitudinal associations between teacher evaluation and reward policies and student mathematics achievement and dropout with a national sample of students (n = 7779) attending one of 431 public high schools. The student sample included an equal number of boys and girls averaging 16 years of age and included a White (53%) majority. This study examined whether associations between teacher policies and student achievement were mediated by the teacher–student relationship climate. Results of this study were threefold. First teacher evaluation policies that allowed students to evaluate their teachers were associated with more positive student reports of the classroom teaching climate. Second schools with teacher reward policies that included assigning higher performing teachers with higher performing students had a negative association with student perceptions of the teaching climate. Lastly schools with better student perceptions of the teaching climate were associated with lower student dropout rates by students’ senior year. These findings are discussed in light of their educational policy implications.,0,Ciencias exactas
Comparative fit indexes in structural models.,"statistics
structural model
degree of freedom
perform",Normed and nonnormed fit indexes are frequently used as adjuncts to chi-square statistics for evaluating the fit of a structural model. A drawback of existing indexes is that they estimate no known population parameters. A new coefficient is proposed to summarize the relative reduction in the noncentrality parameters of 2 nested models. Two estimators of the coefficient yield new normed (CFIN) and nonnormed (FIN) fit indexes. CFIN avoids the underestimation of fit often noted in small samples for P. M. Bentler and D. G. Bonett's (see record 1981-06898-001) normed fit index (NFIN). FIN is a linear function of Bentler and Bonett's nonnormed fit index (NNFIN) that avoids the extreme underestimation and overestimation often found in NNFIN. Asymptotically CFIN FIN NFIN and a new index developed by K. A. Bollen (1989) are equivalent measures of comparative fit whereas NNFIN measures relative fit by comparing noncentrality per degree of freedom. All of the indexes are generalized to permit use of Wald and Lagrange multiplier statistics. An example illustrates the behavior of these indexes under conditions of correct specification and misspecification. The new fit indexes perform very well at all sample sizes. ,0,Ciencias exactas
Attachment in the Classroom,"Attachment
Achievement
School bonding
Teacher–student relationship",Attachment influences students’ school success. This is true of students’ attachment to their parents as well as to their teachers. Secure attachment is associated with higher grades and standardized test scores compared to insecure attachment. Secure attachment is also associated with greater emotional regulation social competence and willingness to take on challenges and with lower levels of ADHD and delinquency each of which in turn is associated with higher achievement. These effects tend to be stronger for high-risk students. In this era of accountability enhancing teacher–student relationships is not merely an add-on but rather is fundamental to raising achievement. Understanding the role of attachment in the classroom will help educators be more effective particularly with challenging students. Twelve suggestions to improve teacher–student relationships and school bonding are provided.,0,Ciencias exactas

environment",The present study examined whether and how socioeconomic status (SES) predicts school achievement in science technology engineering and math (STEM) using structural equation modeling and data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Child Care and Youth Development. The present inquiry addresses gaps in previous research linking SES and STEM achievement in high school. Results indicate that maternal education predicts the child’s early environment which itself predicts the development of executive function (EF) and language and thereby STEM achievement. Moreover children’s language ability and EF development influenced higher-order cognitive skills such as relational reasoning planning and basic calculation skills. However only relational reasoning strongly predicted high school math and science achievement suggesting that relational reasoning but not planning and calculation skills was central to STEM thinking and learning.,0,Ciencias exactas

science achievement",The purpose of this study was to discover whether the science motivation beliefs of middle school students (N = 262) vary as a function of their gender or race/ethnicity and to determine whether science self-efficacy beliefs predict science achievement when motivation variables shown to predict achievement in other academic areas are controlled. Girls reported stronger science self-efficacy and self-efficacy for self-regulation and they received higher grades in science. Boys had stronger performance-approach goals. White students had stronger self-efficacy and achievement and African American students reported stronger task goals. Self-efficacy was the only motivation variable to predict the science achievement of girls boys and White students. Self-efficacy and self-concept predicted the science achievement of African American students. Results are interpreted from the perspective of Bandura’s social cognitive theory.,0,Ciencias exactas
The quality of teacher–student interactions: Associations with first graders' academic and behavioral outcomes,"Teacher–student interactions
Classroom quality
First grade",The associations between the quality of teacher–student interactions and first grade academic and adaptive behavior outcomes were examined in a study of 106 Portuguese students in 64 first grade classrooms. Students' vocabulary print concepts math and adaptive skills were assessed both at the end of preschool and in first grade. Classrooms were observed in the spring of first grade. After taking into account family risk factors and preschool skills the quality of teacher–student interactions particularly in terms of classroom organization was positively associated with students' first grade vocabulary and print concepts. In addition classroom quality predicted number identification outcomes differently depending on student skills prior to school entry. Students with lower preschool math skills seemed to benefit from higher quality teacher–student interactions. These findings provide further support for the unique contribution of the quality of teacher–student interactions in first grade and suggest that it may be an important mechanism to improve academic skills.,0,Ciencias exactas

In creating the instrument three relevant twenty-first century competency frameworks were referenced: from the OECD the European Council and the USA. The preliminary version of this instrument which consists of 55 items was administered to 732 Shanghai students from three types of K-12 schools. To investigate the factors and the structure of the competencies that young Chinese learners’ in the twenty-first century should possess exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modeling were employed. This resulted in a selection of 42 items in seven categories. These were conceptions of learning competencies in ICT problem solving communication critical thinking cross-cultural communication and advanced-level literacy. Based on these findings the status of students’ twenty-first century competencies in Shanghai were investigated in relation to gender region and grade. The implications of the findings were discussed such as balancing the learning resource and teacher deployment in differently developed regions as well as guiding the implementation of a competency-based curriculum in China.,0,Ciencias exactas
Measuring mathematics self-efficacy as a learning outcome,"mathematics self-efficacy
post-compulsory
Rasch analysis",We report the construction and validation of a self-report ‘Mathematics self-efficacy (MSE)’ instrument designed to measure this construct as a learning outcome of students following post-compulsory mathematics programmes. The sample ranged across two programmes: a traditional preparation for university study in mathematical subjects (Advanced level) and an innovative ‘modelling’-based programme intended to widen participation in mathematics through use of technology and coursework. We report Rasch measurement and Generalised Linear modelling analyses of large scale survey data and occasionally we draw on learners' interviews for triangulation. We found that MSE is related to students' mathematical attainment and gender as well as their dispositions to further study mathematics. We also show significant differences between students' development of MSE in the two programmes. In conclusion we propose that MSE deserves further attention as a measure of valued learning outcomes.,1,Ciencias exactas
Self-evaluative and self-efficacy mechanisms governing the motivational effects of goal systems.,"self-evaluative

performance motivation
self-reactive",Tested the hypothesis that self-evaluative and self-efficacy mechanisms mediate the effects of goal systems on performance motivation. These self-reactive influences are activated through cognitive comparison requiring both personal standards and knowledge of performance. 45 male and 45 female undergraduates performed a strenuous activity with either goals and performance feedback goals alone feedback alone or without either factor. The condition combining performance information and a standard had a strong motivational impact whereas neither goals alone nor feedback alone effected changes in motivation. When both comparative factors were present the evaluative and efficacy self-reactive influences predicted the magnitude of motivation enhancement. The higher the self-dissatisfaction with substandard performance and the stronger the perceived self-efficacy for goal attainment the greater was the subsequent intensification of effort. When one comparative factor was lacking the self-reactive influences were differentially related to performance motivation depending on the nature of the partial information and on the type of subjective comparative structure imposed on the activity.,0,Ciencias exactas

Based on results obtained from a pilot sample of college students an instrument assessing mathematics self-efficacy expectations was developed. The items used in the mathematics self-efficacy scale included everyday math tasks math problems and math-based college courses. Subjects 153 female and 109 male undergraduates completed the mathematics self-efficacy scale the Bem Sex Role Inventory an adapted version of the Fennema-Sherman Mathematics Attitudes Scales and a questionnaire concerning their college major choices. Results indicated that mathematics self-efficacy expectations were significantly related to the extent to which students selected science-based college majors thus supporting the postulated role of cognitive mediational factors in educational and career choice behavior. In addition the math-related self-efficacy expectations of college males were significantly stronger than were those of college females. Implications of the findings for the process of educational and career decision-making are discussed.,0,Ciencias exactas

The article begins by summarizing Bandura's self-efficacy theory including its particular relevance to women's career development. Next the domains of occupational scientific—technical and mathematics self-efficacy are reviewed followed by those represented by Holland's RIASEC model and Rooney and Osipow's (1992 Osipow Temple & Rooney 1993) Task-Specific Occupational Self-Efficacy Scale (TSOSS). The article concludes with a review of work on the relationship of self-efficacy to vocational interests and on counseling implications of self-efficacy theory.,0,Ciencias exactas
“I would rather die”: reasons given by 16-year-olds for not continuing their study of mathematics,"participation
attitudes
post-compulsory",Improving participation rates in specialist mathematics after the subject ceases to be compulsory at age 16 is part of government policy in England. This article provides independent and recent support for earlier findings concerning reasons for non-participation based on free response and closed items in a questionnaire with a sample of over 1500 students in 17 schools close to the moment of choice. The analysis supports findings that perceived difficulty and lack of confidence are important reasons for students not continuing with mathematics and that perceived dislike and boredom and lack of relevance are also factors. There is a close relationship between reasons for non-participation and predicted grade and a weaker relation to gender. An analysis of the effects of schools demonstrates that enjoyment is the main factor differentiating schools with high and low participation indices. Building on discussion of these findings ways of improving participation are briefly suggested.,0,Ciencias exactas

self-efficacy",In this cross-national study the authors compared mathematics self-efficacy beliefs of American (n = 107) and Taiwanese (n = 188) middle-school students for level and calibration (accuracy and bias). Taiwanese students surpassed Americans in math achievement. American students evidenced slightly higher self-efficacy levels for easy math items but a steeper decline for moderately difficult items than did Taiwanese students. Nationality differences in level of self-efficacy diminished for difficult math items. For calibration American students reported less accurate self-efficacy beliefs than did Taiwanese students for all items although the accuracy of both groups declined with items of higher difficulty. Postperformance self-evaluation judgments of Taiwanese students decreased as item difficulty increased whereas American students' judgments decreased from easy items to moderate items but remained unchanged with difficult items. The authors found no effects for gender or gender-nationality interactions on any dependent measure.,0,Ciencias exactas

regression models",Complex statistical models-especially those incorporating interactions among independent variables-are frequently difficult to interpret and such models are used increasingly in social research. This paper describes how to explicate a model by calculating and graphing portions of the fitted response surface. The basic approach is first to identify the high-order terms of the model and then to manipulate the independent variables in each such term over their ranges while fixing other independent variables to typical values. Effect displays of this type are developed for generalized linear models which include linear regression models analysis-of-variance models log-linear models logit models etc. The methods presented here represent an extension of previous work on adjusted means in analysis of variance and analysis of covariance. Standard errors for displayed effects are also considered.,0,Ciencias exactas

Mathematics performance was correlated moderately with mathematics self-efficacy. No support was found for Hackett and Betz's (1981) hypothesis that women's mathematics self-efficacy expectations are unrealistically low compared to men's. Both mathematics performance and mathematics self-efficacy were significantly and positively correlated with attitudes toward mathematics masculine sex-role orientation and a mathematics-related major. Regression analyses supported the superiority of mathematics self-efficacy over mathematics performance and achievement variables in predicting the choice of a mathematics-related major.,0,Ciencias exactas

AS-level",This paper investigates enrolment attainment and drop-out rates for two different English pre-university advanced mathematics AS-level courses a ‘traditional’ and an innovative ‘Use of Mathematics’ pre-university course. Very different student profiles were found for those enrolled on each course and a model of attainment at the pre-university level showed a relatively complex relationship with prior achievement at the end of compulsory schooling. Although those pupils who had relatively high prior achievement tended also to achieve relatively highly on the pre-university courses this relationship was not evident for lower scores. Those pupils with ‘mid-range’ prior attainment tended to make the smallest gains. Taking prior attainment into account the difference in attainment outcomes between the two courses is small. However these courses do differ with respect to the number of students retained with the ‘Use of Mathematics’ course retaining a significantly higher proportion of the students. Contextual factors are discussed suggesting implications for policy and practice in mathematics education.,0,Ciencias exactas

Results revealed that math self-efficacy was more predictive of problem solving than was math self-concept perceived usefulness of mathematics prior experience with mathematics or gender (N = 350). Self-efficacy also mediated the effect of gender and prior experience on self-concept perceived usefulness and problem solving. Gender and prior experience influenced self-concept perceived usefulness and problem solving largely through the mediational role of self-efficacy. Men had higher performance self-efficacy and self-concept and lower anxiety but these differences were due largely to the influence of self-efficacy for gender had a direct effect only on self-efficacy and a prior experience variable. Results support the hypothesized role of self-efficacy in A. Bandura's (1986) social cognitive theory.,0,Ciencias exactas

assessed",In this study 391 students were asked to provide 3 types of mathematics self-efficacy judgments: confidence to solve mathematics problems confidence to succeed in math-related courses and confidence to perform math-related tasks. Criterial tasks were solution of math problems and choice of math-related majors. As hypothesized students' reported confidence to solve the problems they were later asked to solve was a more powerful predictor of that performance than was either their confidence to perform math-related tasks or to succeed in math-related courses. Similarly confidence to succeed in math-related courses was a stronger predictor of choice of math-related majors than was either confidence to solve problems or to perform math-related tasks. Results support A. Bandura's (1986) contention that because judgments of self-efficacy are task specific measures of self-efficacy should be tailored to the criterial task being assessed and the domain of functioning being analyzed to increase prediction.,0,Ciencias exactas

performance relationship",The mathematics self-efficacy and problem-solving performance of 327 middle-school students were assessed using two forms of assessment (traditional multiple-choice vs. open-ended fill-in-the-blank). The purpose was to determine whether varying the assessment format would influence students' self-efficacy judgments or alter the relationship between self-efficacy and performance. No differences in self-efficacy resulted from the different forms of assessment Students who took the multiple-choice performance test obtained higher scores than did students who took the open-ended test The latter group had poorer calibration that is the degree to which students' judgments of their capability reflect their actual competence. This finding suggests that students' self-perceptions of their mathematics capability may be less accurate than has previously been reported or that students' familiarity with traditional assessment formats creates an expectancy of a performance task that is multiple choice in nature this expectancy influences self-efficacy judgments regardless of the format used to assess confidence. Differences in the format for assessing self-efficacy and performance altered the predictive utility of self-efficacy judgments. These differences must be accounted for in subsequent studies before researchers can make sound generalizations about the strength of the self-efficacy/performance relationship or the accuracy of students' self-perceptions.,0,Ciencias exactas

Results from Phase 1 (N = 1111) were used to develop and refine items for subsequent use. In Phase 2 of the study (N = 824) a 39-item four-factor exploratory model fit best. Items were revised to strengthen psychometric properties. In Phase 3 (N = 803) a 24-item four-factor confirmatory factor model fit best. This final model was invariant across gender and ethnicity. Subscales correlated with self-efficacy self-concept mastery goals and optimism. Results suggest that the sources scale is psychometrically sound and could be adapted for use in other domains.,0,Ciencias exactas
