Gender differences in mental health,gender differences healthseek ing behaviour mental disorders sex,Effective strategies for mental disorders prevention and its risk factors’ reduction cannot be gender neutral while the risks themselves are gender specifi c. This paper aims to discuss why gender matters in mental health to explain the relationship of gender and health-seeking behaviour as a powerful determinant of gender differences to examine the gender differences in common mental health disorders namely depressive and anxiety disorders eating disorders schizophrenia and domestic violence and fi nally to raise some recommendations stemming from this review.,1,Ciencias Sociales
Placing gender at the centre of health programming: challenges and limitations,health planning equality analysis sensitivity,In this paper we argue that a gender analysis is fundamental to health and health planning. We begin with a definition of gender and related concepts including equity and equality. We discuss why gender is key to understanding all dimensions of health including health care health seeking behaviour and health status and how a gender analysis can contribute to improved health policies and programming. Despite the many reasons for incorporating gender issues in health policies and programmes many obstacles remain including the lack of attention to gender in the training of health professionals and the lack of awareness and sensitivity to gender concerns and disparities in the biomedical community. We argue that the key to placing gender values firmly in place in Health for All renewal is a change in philosophy at all levels of the health sector and suggest ways in which such a change can be implemented in the areas of policy research training and practical programmes and interventions.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Women's status and the health of women and men: a view from the States,study measures status inequality health inequality,We examined the status of women in the 50 American states in relation to women's and men's levels of health. The status of women in each state was assessed by four composite indices measuring women's political participation economic autonomy employment and earnings and reproductive rights. The study design was cross-sectional and ecologic. Our main outcome measures were total female and male mortality rates female cause-specific death rates and mean days of activity limitations reported by women during the previous month. Measures of women's status were strikingly correlated with each of these health outcomes at the state level. Higher political participation by women was correlated with lower female mortality rates (r = -0.51) as well as lower activity limitations (-0.47). A smaller wage gap between women and men was associated with lower female mortality rates (-0.30) and lower activity limitations (-0.31) (all correlations P < 0.05). Indices of women's status were also strongly correlated with male mortality rates suggesting that women's status may reflect more general underlying structural processes associated with material deprivation and income inequality. However the indices of women's status persisted in predicting female mortality and morbidity rates after adjusting for income inequality poverty rates and median household income. Associations were observed for specific causes of death including stroke cervical cancer and homicide. We conclude that women experience higher mortality and morbidity in states where they have lower levels of political participation and economic autonomy. Living in such states has detrimental consequences for the health of men as well. Gender inequality and truncated opportunities for women may be one of the pathways by which the maldistribution of income adversely affects the health of women.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Gender socioeconomic development and health-seeking behaviour in Bangladesh,Adolescent Adult Female Male Middle Aged Patient Acceptance of Health Care / statistics & numerical data* Sex Factors Social Class,In efforts to reduce gender and socioeconomic disparities in the health of populations the provision of medical services alone is clearly inadequate. While socioeconomic development is assumed important in rectifying gender and socioeconomic inequities in health care access service use and ultimately outcomes empirical evidence of its impact is limited. Using cross-sectional data from the BRAC-ICDDRB Joint Research Project in Matlab Bangladesh this paper examines the impact of membership in BRAC's integrated Rural Development Programme (RDP) on gender equity and health-seeking behaviour. Differences in health care seeking are explored by comparing a sample of households who are BRAC members with a sample of BRAC-eligible non-members. Individuals from the BRAC member group report significantly less morbidity (15-day recall) than those from the non-member group although no gender differences in the prevalence of self-reported morbidity are apparent in either group. Sick individuals from BRAC member households tend to seek care less frequently than non-members. When treatment is sought BRAC members rely to a greater extent on home remedies traditional care and unqualified allopaths than non-member households. While reported treatment seeking from qualified allopaths is more prevalent in the BRAC group non-members use the para-professional services of community health care workers almost twice as frequently. In both BRAC member and non-member groups women suffering illness report seeking care significantly less often than men. The policy and programmatic implications of between group and gender differences in care seeking are discussed with reference to the literature.,0,Ciencias Sociales
The relationship of women's postpartum mental health to employment childbirth and social support,mental health conducted examine associated mental problems,Background: This study was conducted to examine changes in women's mental health over the first postpartum year and factors that are associated with mental health. Methods: Participants included women who were married employed English-speaking and giving birth to their first child at one of two hospitals in St Paul Minnesota. Women who were eligible and willing to participate were mailed questionnaires at 1 3 6 9 and 12 months postpartum. Results: There were significant changes in mothers' general mental health depression and anxiety over the first postpartum year (P < or = .01) with least favorable outcomes at 1 month and most favorable outcomes at 12 months postpartum. Poor mental health was related to work factors such as longer work hours and maternity leave of less than 24 weeks and to variables often associated with recent childbirth such as maternal fatigue loss of sleep concerns about appearance and infant illnesses. In addition postpartum symptoms were predicted by physical illness previous mental problems poor general health poor social support fewer recreational activities young age and low income (R2 = 37% to 57%).Conclusions: In this select group of women postpartum mental health was found to be least favorable 1 month after delivery and related to factors associated with employment recent delivery and level of social support.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Gender differences in electroconvulsive therapy: a retrospective chart review,differences study compared gender difference ,"Background: There is a growing interest in gender differences of different psychiatric disorders especially major depression. We sought a possible gender difference related to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).

Methods: This retrospective study compared 20 male and 23 female depressed adult patients treated by ECT. We compared their findings on gender differences to those of 12 female and 4 male bipolar patients and 11 male and 19 female schizophrenic patients all treated in the same ECT setting.

Results: Depressed female patients underwent significantly fewer antidepressant drug trials than males before being referred to ECT (t41=2.09 P<0.05). A similar gender difference was found in the treatment of patients suffering from schizophrenia: female patients underwent fewer pharmacological antipsychotic trials than males before being referred to ECT (t28=3.11 P<0.01). ECT was significantly more effective in female patients than in male patients suffering from schizophrenia (U=38 P<0.05).
Limitations: This is a retrospective pilot study whose results are based on subjective evaluations. Conclusion: The findings of this study may support a gender difference both in referral and in the outcome of ECT. Clinical relevance: there might be a need to consider lowering the number of pre-ECT drug trials for depressed males and to consider ECT as a viable therapeutic option for schizophrenic females.",0,Ciencias Sociales
Exploring Gender Difference in Depression,studies differendes gender depressive disorders depression,Most studies have found clear gender differences in the prevalence of depressive disorders. Typically studies report that women have a prevalence rate for depression up to twice that of men (Bebbington 1996 Nolen-Hoeksema 1987). For example Kessler et al. (1994) reported that women in the United States are about two-thirds more likely than men to be depressed and a national psychiatric morbidity survey in Britain showed a similar greater risk of depression for women (Meltzer et al. 1995). Gender differences in depression appear to be at their greatest during reproductive years (Bebbington 1996). Recently my colleagues and I set out to explore some of the possible explanations for gender differences in depression (Nazroo et al. 1997 1998). A starting point to our research was Brown and Harris (1978) who showed that episodes of depression were almost always preceded by a major life event a finding that has been confirmed in a number of other studies. Our sample consisted of 97 couples recruited from an inner city area in Britain who had experienced a total of 115 shared crises made up of one or more major life events. The members of each couple were interviewed separately by different interviewers. The interviews covered the nature of the crisis responses to the crisis role behaviors responsibilities and role commitment quality of marriage childhood experiences and psychiatric disorders. The latter were assessed using a shortened version of the Present State Examination which covers a wide range of psychiatric symptoms and allowed the use of clinically validated diagnostic thresholds.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Social determinants of health: the solid facts,health social enviroment social influences,This book covers the lifelong importance to health of determinants such as poverty drugs working conditions unemployment social support good food and transport policy. It provides a discussion of the social gradient in health and an explanation of how psychological and social influences affect physical health and longevity. The focus is on the role that public policy can play in shaping the social environment and on structural issues such as unemployment poverty and the experience of work. Each of the chapters contains a brief summary of what has been established by research followed by some implications for public policy.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Gender differences in depression: the role of personality factors,depression association contrast diferrences gender,The goal of the study was to determine the association between gender and the Big Five personality factors and to identify the role of personality factors in the association between gender and depression among adults in the United States. Data were drawn from the Midlife Development in the United States Survey (N=3032). Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to examine gender differences on the Big Five personality factors (i.e. agreeableness neuroticism openness to experience extraversion and conscientiousness). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the relation between gender and depression and to test whether this association is moderated by neuroticism. Levels of neuroticism agreeableness extraversion and conscientiousness were significantly higher among females than among males in contrast level of openness to experience was significantly higher among males. Female gender was associated with increased odds of experiencing depression. Results showed that neuroticism played a significant contributory role in the relationship between being female and major depression though the role of gender remained statistically significant after adjustment. These data suggest that gender differences in personality factors specifically neuroticism may play a key role in the well-documented gender difference in depression. Our findings indicate that neuroticism may moderate the association between female gender and increased risk of depression among adults. These findings require replication using longitudinal data.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Adolescent depression: a review,depression psychological medication social determinants,"Objective: To review the characteristic clinical illness course and risk factors to adolescent depression. Method: A literature review is provided with interpretive comments. Results: The clinical feature profile is likely to reflect the rarity of melancholic depression while the non-melancholic ""irritable hostile"" pattern appears distinctly increased. A ""reactive depressive disorder"" is rare in those who get to psychiatric assessment while comorbidity (e.g. anxiety and personality disorders illicit drug use) is the rule. Aetiological determinants and the prognosis generally more relate to comorbid factors than to depression per se. Predisposing and precipitating psychological and social determinants are considered while the efficacies of varying antidepressant strategies remain unclear apart from those with an ""anxious"" or ""irritable"" depression where selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor medication has shown utility and where cognitive-behavioural therapy may be relevant. Conclusions: For the majority who develop adolescent depression its expression and outcome appear more a reflection of the propagating determinants most commonly anxiety and personality style. The clinician should determine a treatment plan that not only addresses the depression but which identifies and addresses the contributing features.",0,Ciencias Sociales
Gender differences in general practice consultations: methodological challenges in epidemiological research,Epidemiologic Research Design* Family Practice / statistics & numerical data* Female Health Care Rationing Health Status Humans Male,Background: Women consult their GP more often than men do. The distribution of complaints and diagnoses are different for women and men patients. Although several findings on gender differentials on mortality and health care consumption are rather consistent across studies detailed findings and subsequent conclusions diverge in several important fields. Objectives: Our aim was to explore methodological aspects of research on gender differences in general practice. Methods: We reviewed empirical studies within this field aiming to identify methodological and interpretative intricacies which deserve special attention in epidemiological research on GP consultations. Results and conclusions: We found that descriptive and explanatory levels of research are frequently confused. Simple questions answers and explanations are commonly raised for complex issues within a poorly defined theoretical explanatory framework. There is a need to assess relevant approaches for various purposes and to develop more uniform conceptual terms. Findings from one level are often transferred to another incompatible level. Epidemiological issues must be considered especially matters related to denominator level and standardization/confounders-not in order to decide which level represents 'reality' but to clarify the consequences of different measures for different research questions. The contents of the core variables and the potentials for bias should be discussed in order to provide a sound basis for future explanatory studies.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Psychosocial and mental health aspects of women's health,Employment Female Humans Marriage Mental Disorders / etiology Mental Health* Role Socioeconomic Factors Women's Health*,Both community-based studies and studies of treatment seekers indicate that women are disproportionately affected by mental health problems and that their vulnerability is closely associated with marital status employment and roles in society. Women's mental health cannot be considered in isolation from social political and economic issues. When women's position in society is examined it is clear that there are sufficient causes in current social arrangements to account for the surfeit of depression and anxiety experienced by women.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Gender Differences in Age at Onset of Schizophrenia,studies females males gender differencesschizophrenia,We present the results of a review of the literature concerning gender differences in age at the onset of schizophrenia. In view of the very consistent finding that the first admission to hospital for schizophrenia occurs on average earlier in men than in women we examined the question whether this is due to the fact that the psychosis manifests itself earlier in men or that the period between first manifestation and admission to hospital is shorter than in women. By means of a metaanalytic approach we then looked for evidence for the existence of local or temporal variations in the degree of gender difference. Lastly we dealt with the question whether gender differences in age of onset can be observed in other functional psychoses.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Sex and gender differences in health,biological gender sex healththerapies,Men and women are alike in many ways. However there are important biological and behavioural differences between the two genders. They affect manifestation epidemiology and pathophysiology of many widespread diseases and the approach to health care. Despite our knowledge of these crucial differences there is little gender-specific health care the prevention management and therapeutic treatment of many common diseases does not reflect the most obvious and most important risk factors for the patient: sex and gender. This omission is holding back more efficient health care as gender-based prevention measures or therapies are probably more effective than the usual ‘one-size-fits all' approach and would benefit patients of both genders. Addressing gender in health and health care therefore requires new approaches at many levels from training medical personal to clinical medicine epidemiology and drug development.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Similarities and Differences of Mental Health in Women and Men: A Systematic Review of Findings in Three Large German Cohorts,indentify gender health social factors physical health,In Germany large population-based cohort studies have been implemented in order to identify risk and protective factors for maintaining health across the life span. The purpose of this systematic review is to analyse findings from three large ongoing cohorts and to identify sex-specific prevalence rates risk and protective factors for mental health. Published studies from the Cooperative Health Research in the Region Augsburg (KORA) the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) and the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS)) representing the southern north-eastern and middle parts of Germany were identified through searches of the databases PubMed and Web of Science. A total of 52 articles was identified from the start of each cohort until June 2019. Articles reporting prevalence rates of mental health [N = 22] explanatory factors for mental health [N = 25] or both [N = 5] were identified. Consistent across cohorts higher prevalence rates of internalizing disorders were found for women and more externalizing disorders for men. Risk and protective factors for mental health included social factors lifestyle physical health body mass index (BMI) diabetes genetic and biological factors. In all areas differences and similarities were found between women and men. The most evident were the sex-specific risk profiles for depression with mostly external risk factors for men and internal risk factors for women. Gender was not assessed directly therefore we examined whether socioeconomic and family-related factors reflecting gender roles or institutionalized gender could be used as a proxy for gender. Overall this systematic review shows differences and similarities in prevalence rates and determinants of mental health indicators between women and men. They underline the importance of focussing on sex specific approaches in mental health research and in the development of prevention measures. Current research on mental health still lacks focus on gender aspects. Therefore an increased focus on sex and gender in mental health research is of great importance.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Gender Differences in the Prevalence of Somatic Versus Pure Depression: A Replication,depression study women men dysphoria gender gender diference,OBJECTIVE: Using data from the Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) study the author attempted to replicate the finding of the National Comorbidity Survey that the prevalence of depression associated with somatic symptoms was much higher among women than men. METHOD: The author reanalyzed data from the ECA study. He divided respondents into those who met criteria for major depression and exhibited appetite and sleep disturbances and fatigue (somatic depression) and those who met depression criteria but did not exhibit all of these somatic criteria (pure depression). RESULTS: The reanalysis revealed that the prevalence of somatic depression but not pure depression was much higher among women than men. Somatic depression was associated with high rates of pain among women it was associated with high rates of anxiety disorders and chronic dysphoria. CONCLUSIONS: The gender difference in depression may result from a difference in a specific type of depression—anxious somatic depression.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Stability Radii-Based Interval Observers for Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems,"Observers Discrete-time systems Asymptotic stability Uncertainty Trajectory
Estimation error Linear matrix inequalities",In this paper we investigate the interval observer problem for a class of discrete-time nonlinear systems in absence or presence of external disturbances and parametric uncertainties. The interval observers depend on the design of two preserving order observers providing lower and upper estimations of the state. The main objective is to apply the stability radii notions and cooperativity property in the estimation error systems in order to guarantee that the lower/upper estimation is always below/above the real state trajectory at each time instant from an appropriate initialization and the estimation errors converge asymptotically towards zero when the disturbances and/or uncertainties are vanishing. For the disturbed case the estimation errors practically converge to a vicinity of zero while the lower/upper estimations preserve the partial ordering with respect to the state trajectory. The design conditions that are valid for Lipschitz nonlinearities can be expressed as Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). A numerical simulation example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.,1,Ciencias Sociales
Observers for Lipschitz nonlinear systems,Nonlinear systems Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions Asymptotic stability Sufficient conditions Riccati equations Robots Linearity Estimation error Yield estimation Algorithm design and analysis,This paper presents some fundamental insights into observer design for the class of Lipschitz nonlinear systems. The stability of the nonlinear observer for such systems is not determined purely by the eigenvalues of the linear stability matrix. The correct necessary and sufficient conditions on the stability matrix that ensure asymptotic stability of the observer are presented. These conditions are then reformulated to obtain a sufficient condition for stability in terms of the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the linear stability matrix. The eigenvalues have to be located sufficiently far out into the left half-plane and the eigenvectors also have to be sufficiently well-conditioned for ensuring asymptotic stability. Based on these results a systematic computational algorithm is then presented for obtaining the observer gain matrix so as to achieve the objective of asymptotic stability.,0,Ciencias Sociales

A new dynamic framework which is a generalization of previously used Lipschitz observers is introduced and the generalized sufficient condition that ensures asymptotic convergence of the state estimates is presented. The equivalence between this condition and an H/sub /spl infin// optimal control problem which satisfies the standard regularity assumptions in H/sub /spl infin// optimization theory is shown and a parameterization of all possible observers is also presented. A design procedure which is less restrictive than the existing design approaches is proposed and a simulation example is given to illustrate the observer design.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Nonlinear observers: a circle criterion design and robustness analysis,Nonlinearities observer gain matrices,Globally convergent observers are designed for a class of systems with monotonic nonlinearities. The approach is to represent the observer error system as the feedback interconnection of a linear system and a time-varying multivariable sector nonlinearity. Using LMI software observer gain matrices are computed to satisfy the circle criterion and hence to drive the observer error to zero. In output-feedback design the observer is combined with control laws that ensure input-to-state stability with respect to the observer error. Robustness to unmodeled dynamics is achieved with a small-gain assignment design as illustrated on a jet engine compressor example.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Cooperative observers for nonlinear systems,Nonlinear systems Observers Design methodology Convergence State estimation Temperature Cooperative systems Uncertainty Kinetic theory Nonlinear dynamical systems,A new methodology to design preserving order observers for a class of nonlinear systems in absence and in presence of perturbations is proposed. The preserving order observers are those whose estimates always stay above or below the true trajectory of the state. The design methodology combines two important systemic properties: dissipativity and cooperativity. The first is used to assure the convergence of the estimation error dynamics. Cooperativity is the basic property of the error dynamics in order to assure the order preserving properties of the observer. The design of these observers can be reduced in most cases to linear matrix inequalities (LMI).,0,Ciencias Sociales
Coordination Control for Uncertain Networked Systems Using Interval Observers,Observers Additives Symmetric matrices Time-varying systems Automation Decentralized control Cybernetics,In this article we take the coordination control problem of linear time-invariant networked systems with uncertain additive disturbance and uncertain initial states into consideration. A distributed interval observer is first constructed for uncertain networked systems in which the control algorithm of each agent involves only the upper bound information and the lower bound information of the interval observer associated with itself and its neighbors respectively. With the help of the cooperativity theory it is proved that the interval observer can estimate the piecewise state for each agent and the interval-observer-based control algorithm can drive the uncertain system to achieve coordination behavior. Then time-varying coordinate transformation is introduced to construct a novel interval observer which can eliminate the cooperativity premise on the system matrices and bound the states of all agents in real time. It is shown that the novel interval-observer-based control algorithm can guide the uncertain system to reach coordinated behavior. Finally the numerical simulations are provided to verify the theoretical results.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Further Result on Interval Observer Design for Discrete-Time Switched Systems and Application to Circuit Systems,Observers Switched systems Circuits and systems Switches Lyapunov methods,This brief deals with the interval observer design for a class of discrete-time switched systems. In order to reduce the constraints of design conditions and improve the accuracy of estimation the zonotope method is used to estimate the bounds of the system states. First an H ∞ observer is constructed for discretetime switched systems and sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the existence of the H ∞ observer. Then zonotope method is employed to estimate the states based on the designed observer. Finally a numerical example in the background of booster converter is simulated to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Interval Observer Design for Nonlinear Systems: Stability Radii Approach,Observers Nonlinear systems Asymptotic stability Stability analysis Perturbation methods Symmetric matrices Linear matrix inequalities,This paper presents a new approach to design preserving order and interval observers for a family of nonlinear systems in absence and in presence of parametric uncertainties and exogenous disturbances. A preserving order observer provides an upper/lower estimation that is always above/below the state trajectory depending on the partial ordering of the initial conditions and asymptotically converges to its true values in the nominal case. An interval observer is then constituted by means of an upper and a lower preserving order observer. In the uncertain/disturbed case the estimations preserve the partial ordering with respect to the state trajectory and practically converge to the true values despite of the uncertainties/perturbations. The design approach relies on the cooperativity property and the stability radii mathematical tools both applied to the estimation error systems. The objective is to exploit the stability radii analysis for the family of linear positive systems under the time-varying nonlinear perturbations in order to guarantee the exponential convergence property of the observers while the cooperativity condition determines the partial ordering between the trajectories of the state and the estimations. The proposed approach defined for Lipschitz nonlinearities depends only on two observer matrix gains. The design is reduced to the solution of linear matrix inequalities which are given by the cooperative condition and convergence constraints. An illustrative example is presented to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.,0,Ciencias Sociales

Interval State Estimation for a Class of Nonlinear Systems,Observers Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions Equations Linear systems Nonlinear systems Mathematical model Observability,The goal of this technical note is to design interval observers for a class of nonlinear continuous-time systems. The first part of this work shows that it is usually possible to design an interval observer for linear systems by means of linear time-invariant changes of coordinates even if the system is not cooperative. This result is extended to a class of nonlinear systems using partial exact linearisations. The proposed observers guarantee to enclose the set of system states that is consistent with the model the disturbances and the measurement noise. Moreover it is only assumed that the measurement noise and the disturbances are bounded without any additional information such as stationarity uncorrelation or type of distribution. The proposed observer is illustrated through numerical simulations.,0,Ciencias Sociales
On interval observer design for time-invariant discrete-time systems,Observers Transmission line matrix methods Equations Mathematical model Vectors Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions,The problem of interval state observer design is addressed for time-invariant discrete-time systems. Two solutions are proposed: the first one is based on a similarity transformation synthesis which connects a constant matrix with its nonnegative representation ensuring the observation error positivity. The second contribution shows that in the discrete-time case the estimation error dynamics always can be represented in a cooperative form without a transformation of coordinates. The corresponding observer gain can be found as a solution of the formulated LMIs. The performances of the proposed observers are demonstrated through computer simulations,0,Ciencias Sociales

Next a reduced-order interval observer design method for descriptor system is presented. The state matrix of the system is obtained by linear transformation and a Sylvester equation is constructed to find the appropriate observer gain matrix. Then an existing design method of full-order interval observer is introduced in this paper. Finally a simulation example is given to demonstrate that the reduced-order interval observer has more accurate interval estimation results than the full-order interval observer,0,Ciencias Sociales

Estimation and Compensation for Lipschitz Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems Subjected to Unknown Measurement Delays,Delays Observers Robustness Symmetric matrices Estimation error Nonlinear systems,Unknown measurement delays usually degrade system performance and even damage a system under output feedback control which motivate us to develop an effective method to attenuate or offset the adverse effect from the measurement delays. In this paper an augmented observer is proposed for discrete-time Lipschitz nonlinear systems subjected to unknown measurement delays enabling a simultaneous estimation for system states and perturbed terms caused by output delays. On the basis of the estimates a sensor compensation technique is addressed to remove the influence from the measurement delays to the system performance. Furthermore an integrated robust estimation and compensation technique is proposed to decouple constant piecewise disturbances attenuate other disturbances/noise and offset the adverse effect caused by the measurement delays. The proposed methods are applied to a two-stage chemical reactor with delayed recycle and to an electromechanical servosystem which demonstrate the effectiveness of the present techniques.,0,Ciencias Sociales

Two particular cases involving dc motors are illustrated in simulation and an experiment using a permanent magnet dc motor is presented.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Educational beliefs matter for classroom instruction: A comparative analysis of teachers’ beliefs about the aims of civic  ,COVID-19 pandemic Multi-domain work-life shock events Work and family Identity threat Identity reflection Identity reconstruction,"During the COVID-19 pandemic many countries enforced mandatory stay-at-home orders. The
confinement period that took place may be regarded as a multi-domain work-life shock event
severely disrupting both the professional and the family sphere. Taking an identity lens this study
examines whether and how identity changed during confinment by drawing from a diary study
consisting of 14 working parents who filled out a daily diary over a period of seven weeks of
mandated home confinement in France. The findings suggest how both work-related and familyrelated identity change may occur when individuals are confronted with a multi-domain work-life
shock event such as the pandemic. Further the findings point to three identity responses to this
event: work-life identity threat work-life identity reflection and work-life identity reconstruction. For most participants the seven-week period resulted in significant and positive shifts in
their work and family identities to better align with their internal beliefs rather than relying on
societally imposed expectations about what it means to be a good parent and worker.",1,Ciencias Sociales
Identity Regulation as Organizational Control: Producing the Appropriate Individual,identtity effentively emphasized normative control,This paper takes the regulation of identity as a focus for examining organizational control. It considers how employees are enjoined to develop self-images and work orientations that are deemed congruent with managerially defined objectives. This focus on identity extends and deepens themes developed within other analyses of normative control. Empirical materials are deployed to illustrate how managerial intervention operates more or less intentionally and in/effectively to influence employees’ self-constructions in terms of coherence distinctiveness and commitment. The processual nature of such control is emphasized arguing that it exists in tension with other intra and extra-organizational claims upon employees’ sense of identity in a way that can open a space for forms of micro-emancipation.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Normalizing Dirty Work: Managerial Tactics For Countering Occupational Taint,Dirty work occupations managers,Dirty work refers to occupations that are viewed by society as physically socially or morally tainted. Using exploratory semistructured interviews with managers from 18 dirty work occupations we investigated the challenges of being a manager in tainted work and how managers normalize taint--that is actively counter it or render it less salient. Managers reported experiencing role complexity and stigma awareness. Four types of practices for countering taint were revealed: occupational ideologies social buffers confronting clients and the public and defensive tactics. We discuss links between these practices.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Examining boundaries to understand the impact of COVID-19 on vocational behaviors,Remote work Working-from-home Border control Travel restrictions Pandemic,The COVID-19 has posed an unprecedented challenge to the global workforce. To better understand the impact of the pandemic on work and careers I call for research taking a closer look at the boundaries in the career context. Specifically both the micro (boundaries that demarcate role domains) and macro (national borders) boundaries should be considered. The pandemic changes the existing boundaries and challenges the “usual” practices while it blurs the micro cross-domain boundaries it strengthens the macro cross-country boundaries. I propose that the changes in the micro and macro boundaries are one of the important mechanisms in how COVID-19 affects many individuals' vocational behaviors and career outcomes. In this essay I explain why we should pay more attention to the boundaries to learn about the impact of COVID-19 on vocational and career behaviors. I conclude with a discussion of several directions for future research.,0,Ciencias Sociales
When work and family collide: Deciding between competing role demands,Work–family conflict Work–family interference Role pressure Role salience Self-esteem,This study examined the factors that influence the decision to participate in a work activity or a competing family activity. Part-time MBA students were presented with a vignette in which they were required to choose between participating in a weekend project team meeting and a surprise birthday party for a parent. Pressures from role senders (managers and spouses) to participate in each activity and the supportiveness of role senders for participation in the other role were manipulated in vignettes and the salience of each role was assessed with self-report scales. Both work and family pressures affected the choice of activity. The salience of work and family roles for respondents also influenced the choice with the effect of family salience stronger for those who were higher in self-esteem and higher in work salience. Implications of the findings for understanding the directionality of work–family interference are identified limitations are discussed and areas for future research are proposed.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Work–nonwork boundary management profiles: A person-centered approach,Work–family boundaries Work–nonwork Work–life,The goal of this paper is to advance the measurement and theory of work–nonwork boundary management styles. Boundary management styles are defined as the approaches individuals use to demarcate boundaries and attend to work and family and other nonwork roles given identity centralities and perceived boundary control. We argue that research should be augmented with a person-centered approach which examines how psychological measures are integrated into configurations. Integrating role and boundary theories we identify three main characteristics of work-nonwork boundary management: (1) cross-role interruption behaviors (work to nonwork and nonwork to work interruptions) (2) identity centrality of work and family roles and (3) perceived control of boundaries. Using a variable-centered approach we refined and validated these measures to create an assessment (Work–Life Indicator) that captured boundary management profiles. The profiles reflect how interruption behaviors identity centralities and boundary control interrelate to cluster into profiles a set of psychological characteristics organized into a pattern of work–nonwork boundary functioning. We identify boundary management profiles and examine their relationships to key work-family outcomes. Regardless of the level and direction of interruption behaviors and centrality of work–family identities we found that low control boundary management profiles (reactors job warriors) tended to experience more negative work and family outcomes than did high control profiles (fusion lovers dividers family guardians eclectics).,0,Ciencias Sociales
Work-Life Events Theory: Making Sense of Shock Events in Dual-Earner Couples,Work–family boundaries Work–non dual-earner couple level process,Dual-earner couples are increasingly prevalent and encounter demands arising from each partner’s commitment to various work and life domains. Unfortunately there has been little theoretical progress in explaining how dual-earner couples navigate work-life shock events which we define as disruptive novel and critical events that require investment of a couple’s resources. Drawing from identity and sensemaking theories we develop a theory of work-life shock events to explain how dual-earner couples perceive and respond to these events. We theorize that partners initially make sense of the event as individuals and then engage in couple-level sensemaking. We argue that each individual’s shock intensity perceptions are shaped by the shock event’s characteristics and the identity factors of role salience hierarchy and future self. A subsequent couple-level process of sensemaking ensues influenced by the salience of the originating domain and partner role as well as relational identity factors. Couple-level shock intensity perceptions result in the couple’s decision regarding resource investment in the shock event’s originating domain. We discuss implications for future research and for organizations.,0,Ciencias Sociales
The family-relatedness of work decisions: A framework and agenda for theory and research,Family-relatedness of work decisions Work–family decision making Work–family conflict Work–family enrichment,Due to global trends such as the increased labor force participation of women the growing presence of dual-earner couples and single parents in the labor force and changing values regarding the importance of life balance individuals' work decisions are being increasingly influenced by family considerations. However the “family-relatedness” of work decisions or the extent to which family situations are considered in these decisions has not been systematically examined. We propose a framework to examine the family-relatedness of work decisions and a broad agenda for future theory and research to test and extend the framework.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Psychological resilience during the COVID-19 lockdown,COVID-19 Pandemic resilience lockdown mental health,Some individuals are more psychologically resilient to adversity than others an issue of great importance during the emerging mental health issues associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. To identify factors that may contribute to greater psychological resilience during the first weeks of the nation-wide lockdown efforts we asked 1004 U.S. adults to complete assessments of resilience mental health and daily behaviors and relationships. Average resilience was lower than published norms but was greater among those who tended to get outside more often exercise more perceive more social support from family friends and significant others sleep better and pray more often. Psychological resilience in the face of the pandemic is related to modifiable factors.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Identity Theory,Gender Identity Identity Theory Moral Identity Affective Commitment Social Identity Theory,Identity theory has developed into an important theoretical framework within sociological social psychology. In this chapter we provide an overview of the central ideas within the theory such as identity verification and identity salience the different methodological approaches (survey and laboratory research) that have been used to study identities and how to measure key concepts. We also review the substantive issues that have advanced the theory such as multiple identities and the role of emotions in the identity process as well as how the theory has been applied to other sociological areas of investigation such as violence research and the sociology of education. Finally we discuss substantive areas for future work such as the study of identity formation and change and we look to how identity theory can be advanced by linking it to other social psychological theories such as affect control theory expectations states theory and social identity theory.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Commitment Identity Salience and Role Behavior: Theory and Research Example,Identity Theory Role Performance Religious Activity Religious Identity Religious Commitment,The generic indeed the defining task of social psychology is to investigate the interrelationships among society the social person and social behavior. Every theoretical perspective or framework in social psychology approaches this immense task by narrowing it by selecting particular dimensions of society persons and behavior as especially worthy of attention. While the ultimate goal for social psychology may be a single unified theoretical framework sufficiently comprehensive to incorporate “all” the “important” aspects etc. of the defining conceptual variables of social psychology1 that goal is not in sight. In the meantime and before the millenium all social psychological perspectives or frameworks are partial selective in their approaches to the world they hope to explicate. That assertion is true of symbolic interactionism the theoretical framework out of which the theory examined in this chapter develops although perhaps less so than for most contemporary frameworks in social psychology.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Measures of Perrow's Work Unit Technology: An Empirical Assessment and a New Scale,Role Performance empirical measures theoretical constructs greater ability,Six instruments previously used to assess Perrow's dimensions of work unit technology are evaluated. The findings suggest convergent validity across measures of the analyzability and exceptions dimensions. A new instrument is developed that has somewhat greater ability to differentiate among work units and that improves the fit between the theoretical constructs and their empirical measures.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Changes to the Work–Family Interface During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Examining Predictors and Implications Using Latent Transition Analysis,COVID-19 work–family conflict and enrichment latent transition analysis technostress supervisor support and compassion,Employees around the world have experienced sudden significant changes in their work and family roles due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However applied psychologists have limited understanding of how employee experiences of work–family conflict and enrichment have been affected by this event and what organizations can do to ensure better employee functioning during such societal crises. Adopting a person-centered approach we examine transitions in employees’ work–family interfaces from before COVID-19 to after its onset. First in Study 1 using latent profile analysis (N = 379 nonpandemic data) we identify profiles of bidirectional conflict and enrichment including beneficial (low conflict and high enrichment) active (medium conflict and enrichment) and passive (low conflict and enrichment). In Study 2 with data collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic we replicate Study 1 profiles and explore whether employees transition between work–family profiles during the pandemic. Results suggest that although many remain in prepandemic profiles positive (from active/passive to beneficial) and negative (from beneficial to active/passive) transitions occurred for a meaningful proportion of respondents. People were more likely to go through negative transitions if they had high segmentation preferences engaged in emotion-focused coping experienced higher technostress and had less compassionate supervisors. In turn negative transitions were associated with negative employee consequences during the pandemic (e.g. lower job satisfaction and job performance and higher turnover intent). We discuss implications for future research and for managing during societal crises both present and future.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Organizing and the Process of Sensemaking,Sensemaking identity studies sensenaking perspective,Sensemaking involves turning circumstances into a situation that is comprehended explicitly in words and that serves as a springboard into action. In this paper we take the position that the concept of sensemaking fills important gaps in organizational theory. The seemingly transient nature of sensemaking belies its central role in the determination of human behavior whether people are acting in formal organizations or elsewhere. Sensemaking is central because it is the primary site where meanings materialize that inform and constrain identity and action. The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the concept of sensemaking. We do so by pinpointing central features of sensemaking some of which have been explicated but neglected some of which have been assumed but not made explicit some of which have changed in significance over time and some of which have been missing all along or have gone awry. We sense joint enthusiasm to restate sensemaking in ways that make it more future oriented more action oriented more macro more closely tied to organizing meshed more boldly with identity more visible more behaviorally defined less sedentary and backward looking more infused with emotion and with issues of sensegiving and persuasion. These key enhancements provide a foundation upon which to build future studies that can strengthen the sensemaking perspective.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Where Do I Go from Here? Sensemaking and the Construction of Growth-Based Stories in the Wake of Denied Promotions,Sensemaking Growth-Based career proactivity theorical contributions,Denied promotions occur when individuals go up for but do not receive promotions at work. The extant literature focuses on the negative implications of denied promotions. We argue in contrast that individuals can ultimately benefit from denied promotions and experience positive outcomes when they construct growth-based stories about the event. Drawing on a sensemaking perspective we articulate when individuals are likely to construct growth-based denied promotion stories highlighting the identity and social conditions that support such stories. We then link growth-based denied promotion stories to the positive behavioral outcomes of work engagement and career proactivity via increases in resilience in their career identities. Finally we situate denied promotions in the broader context of the career and address how responses to denied promotions are influenced by past responses to career setbacks and may shape future responses to career setbacks. Our model provides theoretical contributions to the literature on denied promotions careers positive organizational scholarship and sensemaking.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Betwixt and between identities: Liminal experience in contemporary careers,Identity Liminality Career Identity growth,Liminality defined as a state of being betwixt and between social roles and/or identities is the hallmark of an increasingly precarious and fluctuating career landscape. The generative potential of the liminality construct however has been restricted by six key assumptions stemming from the highly institutionalized nature of the rites of passage originally studied. As originally construed liminality (1) implied both an objective state and the subjective experience of feeling betwixt and between and was (2) temporary (3) obligatory (4) guided by elders and/or supported by a community of fellow liminars (5) rooted in culturally legitimate narratives (6) and led to a progressive outcome i.e. the next logical step in a role hierarchy. By recasting these assumptions as variables we improve the construct’s clarity precision and applicability to contemporary liminal experiences that are increasingly under-institutionalized. We illustrate the utility of our updated conceptualization by arguing that under-institutionalized liminality is both more difficult to endure and more fertile for identity growth than the highly institutionalized experiences that gave rise to the original notion. Drawing from adult development theory we further propose that for under-institutionalized experiences to foster identity growth the identity processes involved need to be more akin to identity play than identity work. We discuss the theoretical implications of our ideas for research on liminality identity and careers.,0,Ciencias Sociales
Gender Differences in Age at Onset of Schizophrenia,studies females males gender differencesschizophrenia,We present the results of a review of the literature concerning gender differences in age at the onset of schizophrenia. In view of the very consistent finding that the first admission to hospital for schizophrenia occurs on average earlier in men than in women we examined the question whether this is due to the fact that the psychosis manifests itself earlier in men or that the period between first manifestation and admission to hospital is shorter than in women. By means of a metaanalytic approach we then looked for evidence for the existence of local or temporal variations in the degree of gender difference. Lastly we dealt with the question whether gender differences in age of onset can be observed in other functional psychoses.,0,Ciencias Sociales
